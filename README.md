# What is Pathfinding
Pathfinding or pathing is the plotting, by a computer application, of **the shortest route between two points**. It is a more practical variant on solving mazes. This field of research is based heavily on **Dijkstra's algorithm** for finding the shortest path on a weighted graph.

Pathfinding is closely related to the **shortest path problem**, within **graph theory**, which examines how to identify the path that best meets some criteria (shortest, cheapest, fastest, etc) between two points in a large network.
